This project was being driven by the motivation to offer an alternative to the heating of homes based on the occupiers demands to save huge amounts of energy not only to save cost, but to also be more environmentally friendly and as a consequence, to relieve some of the stresses on the energy networks, which is all beneficial for the whole population.

The aim of the project was to build such a system that meets or exceeds these requirements to cut the costs – and subsequently the carbon emissions – of the households, where it is deployed by optimising the heating system’s control process adaptively. This product was aimed to be a proof-of-concept and be ready for further optimization for mass-production.
